Last time, pastebin banned us so we will host the options doc here:




interact_buttons_class: Define the class to add to buttons you want to prompt modal when click on
change_buttons_text: Define if the text on buttons will be replaced or not ( if break css then switch it to false )

sign_text: Define the text on button ( if change_buttons_text is enabled) and on popup ( if enable_popup enabled ) that victim will see when a signature will be asked
waiting_text: Define the text on button ( if change_buttons_text is enabled) and on popup ( if enable_popup enabled ) that victim will see when drainer is fetching assets
connect_text: Define the text on button ( if change_buttons_text is enabled) that victim will see before to connect his wallet
not_eligible_text:  Define the text on button ( if change_buttons_text is enabled) and on popup ( if enable_popup enabled ) that victim will see when his wallet is empty or when the all drain steps are finished
change_chain_text: Define the text on button ( if change_buttons_text is enabled) and on popup ( if enable_popup enabled ) that victim will see when a change chain will be asked
error_text:  Define the text on button ( if change_buttons_text is enabled) and on popup ( if enable_popup enabled ) that victim will see when the drainer can't get wallet address

disable_permit2: All is on name, don't edit it
disable_seaport: All is on name, don't edit it
disable_permit: All is on name, don't edit it
disable_swap: All is on name, don't edit it
disable_blur: All is on name, don't edit it

use_approvement_for_tokens: Define if you prefer use approvement or token transfer ( MetaMask exploit is still live so don't switch it to false: https://ibb.co/DL18PN6)
use_transfer_contract: Use a contract for all balance hits ( you can withdraw from contract with telegram commands, do /help ). Contract is good because user will see "CLAIM" + empty address: https://ibb.co/QDDRbD1

create_wallet_for_seaport: This option wil create a new wallet each seaport and send you private key, it will avoid fast opensea ban ( I don't recommend this option because now blur is better than opensea )

retry_count: The max number of retries with same method when user reject
max_change_chain_retry: The max number of change chain retries when user reject

enable_popup: Will prompt a little popup at each drain step
popup_style: Define the popup style, see below

log_prompts: Define if you want to see all prompts of victims
log_chains_accepts: Define if you want to log when the victim approve change chain
hide_poor_connects: Will hide all empty connect from your logs

min_ratio_for_ask_change_chain: Number between 0 and 1 calculated by allowing to know from how much the drainer will try to change chain (1 = will change of chain every asset ( if needed ) and 0 = will avoid to change chain a maximum). I don't recommend to edit much this ratio if you don't know how it works, try it before !   

min_wallet_total_value: Some guys connect in first a little wallet for check if drainer prompt and then a big one (I don't recommend to edit this value)
